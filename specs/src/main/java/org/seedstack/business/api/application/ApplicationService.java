/**
 * This annotation marks its annotated interface as an application service for
 * the framework.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of the annotated interface will be bound to this interface
 * in SEED.
 * <p>
 * Usage :
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}ApplicationService
 * public interface StockService {
 *    
 *    public Availability checkAvailability(Product p);
 * 
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The implementation should look like :
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class StockServiceBase implements StockService {
 * 
 *     public Availability checkAvailability(Product p) {
 *      ...
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * And now the StockService implementation (StockServiceBase) will be available via :
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   {@literal @}Inject
 *   StockService stockService;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Verification will be done by the framework on either or not this service is
 * in the right place.
